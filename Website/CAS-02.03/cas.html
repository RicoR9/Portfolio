                    We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check
                    We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached,
                    But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then
                    
                    Kristen, come right back
                    I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
                    When you light the candle
                    
                    & on the Lower East Side you're dancing with me now
                    & I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
                    Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
                    Think I like you best when you're just with me & no one else...
                    & I'm kissing you lying in my room
                    Holding you until you fall asleep
                    & it's just as good as I knew it would be
                    Stay with me
                    I don't want you to leave...</i>

                    We wander through a foreign town
                    Strangely there’s nobody else around

                    On the swing set at the old playground
                    
                    & when you go away I still see you

                    A love that nobody could destroy
                    Took photographs like Brautigan’s book covers that we both adored…
                    
                    This always happens to me this way
                    Recurring visions of such sweet days

                    But he doesn’t know what to do
                    Sitting in the car waiting outside her school
                    He’s in for a heartbreak if it’s all been blind faith from my point of view
                    
                    Baby, he’s got to be crazy
                    Living like he’s John Wayne
                    Always facing the world or chasing the girl

                    He’s got so much in his heart,
                    But he doesn’t know what to do
                    All he wants is her lying inside his room
                    He’s always feeling cheated telling all his secrets that I couldn’t keep
